## Hello everyoneðŸ‘‹, I'm E.T. Romani

I am a very friendly mathematics enthusiast who enjoys working quietly on my own. I am low-key, love freedom, and am organized in my work. I also have strong mathematical thinking skills.

I am proficient in: algebra (linear algebra, basic group theory, quaternions, Lie groups and Lie algebras), analysis (ordinary differential equations, Fourier analysis, complex analysis, functional analysis), differential manifolds, quantum mechanics, and category theory. I am also an experienced enthusiast in functional programming paradigms and differentiable programming.

The tools I commonly use include:

- Matlab
- Python(Numpy, Polars, Matplotlib, Pytorch, Jax, Maturin, Numba)
- Linux/Raspberry-Pi
- Rust(PyO3, std)
- C/C++/CUDA/HIP/Triton
- Latex, Text Editor(VS Coude)
- Duckdb
- AI(LLM, VLM, Anything-To-Anything)
- My scratch paper and pen

The pursuit of knowledge should not be overly utilitarian. Utilitarianism should only be considered after one has acquired a deep and profound understanding of the subject matter.

Learning knowledge is different from learning skills. Learning knowledge involves systematically understanding its underlying principles, whereas learning skills is more akin to imitation. For example, when learning to program, merely mastering how to use a programming language and call libraries is learning a skill. In contrast, learning knowledge means understanding the design philosophy of the programming language, the characteristics of the compiler, the principles of compilation, and how to design efficient and elegant algorithms based on specific situations.
