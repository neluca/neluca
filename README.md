## Hello everyoneðŸ‘‹, I'm R.T. Romani

I am a very friendly mathematics enthusiast who enjoys working quietly on my own, without any showiness, and I possess strong mathematical thinking skills.

I am proficient in: algebra (linear algebra, basic group theory, quaternions, Lie groups and Lie algebras), analysis (ordinary differential equations, Fourier analysis, complex analysis, functional analysis), differential manifolds, quantum mechanics, and category theory. I am also an experienced enthusiast in functional programming paradigms and differentiable programming.

The tools I commonly use include:

- Matlab
- Python
- Linux
- Rust
- C
- Latex
- My scratch paper and pen
